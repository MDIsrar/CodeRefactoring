Side Effect:
    Function has some functionality which you would no expect it to do.
	    Example createOrder that order AND a task for address validation.

    To solve this code smell:
        Move the side effect to another function of its own.
        Indicate that in the name that the function does the side effect
            Example CreateOrderAndValidateAddressTask
