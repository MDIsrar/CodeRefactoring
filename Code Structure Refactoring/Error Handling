Error Post Mortem
    Could this error be avoided? By changing the code can we avoid not having this error?
	If not, could the user have fixed it by himself if we provided a better error message?
	If not, did we get a good message to the devs so that they could fix it?

	External platforms for managing errors and exceptions : honeybadger, Bugsnag etc.
		Notifications real-time
		Assign team members to errors
