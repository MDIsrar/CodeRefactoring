Be the code minimalist:
    Noise in code (Logs)
        Logs left in the code
            Exception: Some cases logs can be used to provide information an error happen.

    Noise in code (Comments)
	Comments on the code that don't bring any value
		Exception : Comments that can help guide through the code or genral warnings

    Noise in code (Dead or Speculative Code)
        Speculative Code : I don't need it right now, but it might be needed someday
        Dead Code : No longer use of this code but still available in source code.
